### INTRODUCTION

##### Welcome to Drop2comp!

AnTeex Developer ("we", "our" or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy informs you of your choices and our practices regarding any Information (as defined in the "The Information We Collect and How We Collect It" section below) you provide to us.

The use of Drop2comp (through the Drop2comp mobile app, https://drop2comp.com or any third party platforms through which Drop2comp is provided) may involve the collection and use of your Information. It is important for you to understand how this happens and how you may control it, so please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

By using Drop2comp, you agree that we may collect, use and share your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as revised from time to time.

If you wish to contact us regarding this Privacy Policy or any privacy-related matters, please contact us via email at mailto:770386+drop2comp@gmail.com.

##### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

By continuing to use Drop2comp after any changes to this Privacy Policy, with or without notice from us, you are agreeing to the revised Privacy Policy.

##### INFORMATION WE COLLECT
There are three basic categories of information we collect:
* Information you choose to give us.
* Information we get when you use our services.
* Information we get from third parties.

Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.

_Information You Choose to Give Us_

When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, our services require you to set up an account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as a unique username you’d like to go by, an email address.

Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through the services, such as pictures or others files. Keep in mind that the users you send any content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Drop2comp as well: don’t share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.

It probably goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: When you contact Drop2comp Support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.

_Information we get when you use our services_

Information we collect as you use Drop2comp, such as Log Data. "Log Data" is technical information that is automatically collected by us when you use Drop2comp, including:
* Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information.
* Metadata, which means information related to items you have made available through Drop2comp, such as the date, time or location that a shared files.
* Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services.
* The IP address of the device or internet service you use to access Drop2comp.

_Information We Collect from Third Parties_

We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services.
